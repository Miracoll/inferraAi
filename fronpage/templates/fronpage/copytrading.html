                                    <p>Copy trading allows you to directly copy the positions taken by another
                                        trader. You decide the amount you wish to invest and simply copy everything
                                        they do automatically in real-time – when that trader makes a trade, your
                                        account will make that same trade as well.</p>

                                    <p>You do not need to have any input on the trades, and you get the identical
                                        returns on each trade as your chosen trader. But by copying another trader,
                                        you could potentially make money based on their skills. In fact, no advanced
                                        knowledge of the financial market is required to take part!</p>

                                    <p>Copy Trading is both a product and a service. We cater to both the traders
                                        and investors looking to capitalize in the cryptocurrency trading. Being
                                        able to copy trades from several expert traders and also allow investors to
                                        follow one's trades is a great service in and of itself.</p>
                                </div>

                                    <p>We have been trading markets for many years and recently started trading
                                        crypto currencies with much success. We originally wanted to put together a
                                        portfolio of coins and manage everyone's funds in one account but we soon
                                        realized that account segregation and being in control of your funds is the
                                        only way to go, especially if we wanted to bring in outside investors. So,
                                        after looking around and finding out that there was no way for anyone to
                                        copy someone else's trades (unlike any other market), we decided to start
                                        working on this project.</p>

                                    <p>There have been many challenges and obstacles to overcome but when something
                                        is worth pursuing you do it even if it's hard. While the service is still
                                        being refined and improved on the daily bases we are actively connecting
                                        traders and investors for the mutual benefit in crypto currency
                                        trading/investing.</p>

                                    <p>The history of copy trading goes back to 2005 when traders used to copy
                                        specific algorithms that were developed through automated trading. Brokers
                                        recognised the potential of having systems where any linked to that trader
                                        could automatically copy their trading account. There was no need to
                                        constantly monitor email signals or trading 'chat' rooms. We think they were
                                        onto something. Out of this were born services that allowed traders to
                                        connect their personal trading accounts to their platform. Traders no longer
                                        had to submit their specific strategies. The popularity of copy trading has
                                        since exploded.</p>

                                    <p>1 in 3 say a traditional stock market approach is over-complex and this can
                                        be simplified by automatically following traders. 1 in 4 investors said they
                                        were considering Copy trading last year.</p>

                                <div class="how-it-works-section">
                                    <h2>HOW DOES THIS WORK</h2>

                                    <p>Here is how the copier works: You, as an investor, simply select an expert or
                                        experts that you want to copy trades from. Once you are signed up, this is
                                        the only action needed on your part.</p>

                                    <p>Once you've taken care of the above, you are all set. There are no codes that
                                        you need to run or signals for you to manually input. Our software will
                                        handle the trade copying automatically on your behalf. We monitor your
                                        experts trading activity and as soon as there is a trade, we calculate all
                                        the necessary parameters and execute the trade.</p>

                                    <p>The copier works based on trade percent amount. So, for example, if your
                                        expert takes a position in XYZ coin for a total of 10% of his account value
                                        and you are 100% allocated to that expert, then the copier will also execute
                                        a trade in your account in the amount of 10% of your account value.</p>

                                    <p>The only thing you have to make sure of is that you have enough available
                                        base currency that your expert trades with, in your trading account. How
                                        much is enough? First, you must meet the exchanges minimum order amount
                                        (let's say about $10 per trade to be safe). That means that if your expert
                                        executes a 5% order, you must have at least $300 in your account total value
                                        (at 100% expert allocation as an example). This also means that you need to
                                        have at least 10% or higher in available base currency to avoid missed
                                        trades.</p>

                                    <p>When the expert exits a position, you too will exit it. Automatically. You
                                        can also change allocation at any time.</p>

                                    <p>We carefully select expert applicants. We get to know them as a trader and
                                        examine their trading performance over a period of time. We also tend to
                                        look for expert who already have a following to further confirm their
                                        competence (social proof). You can also read about every expert on their
                                        individual performance pages.</p>
