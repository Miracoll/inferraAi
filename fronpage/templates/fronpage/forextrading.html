                                    <h2>Forex Trading Basics</h2>
                                    <p>Forex is short for foreign exchange. The forex market is a place where currencies
                                        are traded. It is the largest and most liquid financial market in the world with
                                        an average daily turnover of 6.6 trillion U.S. dollars as of 2019. The basis of
                                        the forex market is the fluctuations of exchange rates. Forex traders speculate
                                        on the price fluctuations of currency pairs, making money on the difference
                                        between buying and selling prices.</p>
                                </div>

                                <div class="section">
                                    <h3>What is Margin?</h3>
                                    <p>Margin is the amount of a trader's funds required to open a new position. Margin
                                        is estimated based on the size of your trade, which is measured in lots. A
                                        standard lot is 100,000 units. We also provide mini lots (10,000 units), micro
                                        lots (1,000 units) and nano lots (100 units). The greater the lot, the bigger
                                        the margin amount. Margin allows you to trade with leverage, which, in turn,
                                        allows you to place trades larger than the amount of your trading capital.
                                        Leverage influences the margin amount too.</p>

                                    <h3>What is Leverage?</h3>
                                    <p>Leverage is the ability to trade positions larger than the amount of capital you
                                        possess. This mechanism allows traders to use extra funds from a broker in order
                                        to increase the size of their trades. For example, 1:100 leverage means that a
                                        trader who has deposited $1,000 into his or her account can trade with $100,000.
                                        Although leverage lets traders increase their trade size and, consequently,
                                        potential gains, it magnifies their potential losses putting their capital at
                                        risk.</p>

                                    <h3>Forex Market Hours</h3>
                                    <p>Due to different time zones, the international forex market is open 24 hours a
                                        day â€” from 5 p.m. Eastern Standard Time (EST) on Sunday to 4 p.m. EST on Friday,
                                        except holidays. Markets first open in Australasia, then in Europe and
                                        afterwards in North America. So, when the market closes in Australia, traders
                                        can have access to markets in other regions. The 24-hour availability of the
                                        forex market is what makes it so attractive to millions of traders.</p>

                                    <p>In forex trading, currencies are traded in pairs. The first currency in the pair
                                        is called the base currency, while the second is called the quote currency. The
                                        price of a currency pair represents how much of the quote currency is needed to
                                        purchase one unit of the base currency. Major currency pairs include EUR/USD,
                                        USD/JPY, GBP/USD, and USD/CHF.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Fundamental Analysis:</strong> This approach involves analyzing economic
                                        indicators, interest rates, political stability, and other macroeconomic factors
