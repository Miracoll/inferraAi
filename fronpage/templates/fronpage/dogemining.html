                                    <p>Did you know that Dogecoin (DOGE) was intended as a joke? The creators made DOGE
                                        as a mechanism to enable users to tip each other for fun social media content.
                                        Despite the fact that DOGE set off on a whimsical foot, it's become one of the
                                        most popular cryptocurrencies out there.</p>
                                </div>

                                    <h3>Mining Dogecoin Basics</h3>
                                    <p>When it comes to mining DOGE, the fastest and most profitable way to do so is
                                        using ASIC-driven hardware, a rig that uses application specific integrated
                                        circuits or ASICs. You also need to be a member of a DOGE mining pool. In short,
                                        you need three basic things in order to start mining Dogecoins:</p>
                                    <p>A mining rig, you are better off choosing ASIC hardware</p>

                                    <h3>Why Mine Dogecoin?</h3>
                                    <p>Mining Dogecoin can be profitable. There are a couple of reasons why mining
                                        Dogecoin instead of another coin is a good idea. First, transactions on the
                                        Dogecoin blockchain happen quickly so it means that DOGE mining pools tend to
                                        make payouts every 24 hours.</p>
                                    <p>Over and above quick payouts, you can also rely on consistent revenue from
                                        Dogecoin. As a result, mining Dogecoin is efficient and profitable - and a good
                                        prospect. There are also plenty of markets where you can sell your Dogecoin
                                        which means that it is worth considering Dogecoin mining to generate a daily
                                        income for yourself.</p>

                                    <h3>How to Mine Dogecoin</h3>
                                    <p>DOGE is based on the Scrypt hashing algorithm and for that reason the best way to
                                        mine it is using something like the Antminer L3++ as this device makes use of
                                        ASICs. Furthermore, you should seriously consider joining a mining pool when
                                        mining DOGE coins because it is simply the best way to maximise profits.</p>
                                    <p>What does it mean to join a mining pool? It's simple really: you add your mining
                                        power to a group of other people's mining capabilities so that collectively you
                                        can achieve a higher hash rate - which means that it becomes quicker to solve
                                        the problems that lead to a crypto block award. In contrast, mining a single
                                        block on your own can take months or even years which means you will wait a very
                                        long time for any kind of reward, and you will have costs to cover in the
                                        meantime.</p>
                                </div>

                                    <h3>Requirements for Mining DOGE</h3>
                                    <p>There's a couple of things you need in place to mine Dogecoins. Your internet
                                        connection is the first, and we'll suggest that you have uncapped usage on your
                                        connection, but make sure you have at least 0.5GB per day available. Next, you
                                        need a wallet to store your DOGE, you will also use this wallet to cash out your
                                        Dogecoins. DOGE has a free wallet which you can try, but many wallets support
                                        DOGE. So, the four things you need are:</p>
                                    <p>An ASIC miner as your mining rig</p>
                                    <p>Internet that's 24/7, always-on</p>
                                    <p>An estimate of how much power you will consume with your rig</p>
                                    <p>A trustworthy crypto wallet which can receive your Dogecoins</p>
                                </div>

                                <div class="section">
                                    <h3>Additional Considerations</h3>
                                    <p>Mining Dogecoins effectively and risk-free involve a couple of other
                                        complexities. Keep in mind that your mining rig will use a lot of power, so make
                                        sure your home or facility's electrical power grid can support the power
                                        consumption of your mining rigs, particularly if you have several units.</p>
                                    <p>Because your rigs will work around the clock you should also account for heat
                                        build-up because these hardware units can generate a lot of heat. You need to
                                        cool your rigs so that you can make sure they keep on working 24/7 and to make
                                        sure mining performance stays at its maximum. Overheated machines can also be
                                        noisy.</p>
                                    <p>The planning guide to follow will explain what you need to do to deal with the
                                        potential power, heat and noise issues generated by ASIC mining rigs. One other
                                        thing: the lower your latency is on your internet connection, the better your
                                        mining rigs will perform - you'll be able to notify the blockchain of a solved
                                        block faster, so a competing miner won't accidentally beat you to claiming a
                                        solved block.</p>

                                    <h3>Recommended Mining Hardware</h3>
                                    <p>Recently, ASIC mining hardware was released which is able to mine coins using the
                                        Scrypt algorithm, that includes Dogecoin. Amongst your current options we think
                                        Bitmain Antminer L3++ is really your best option because it offers a good
                                        balance between electricity consumption and hashing power - and of course,
                                        price. In comparison the BW L21 has a low hash rate and also uses less power but
                                        the price is far higher for this ASIC rig.</p>

                                    <h3>Configuration Steps</h3>
                                    <p>Because you are mining DOGE with an ASIC rig you don't need to worry about tricky
                                        software downloads and configuration anymore. ASICs come with pre-configured
                                        software pre-installed which means you are ready to get going by doing some
                                        basic configuration. Here are the steps:</p>
                                    <p>Connect your ASIC rig to the internet and supply electricity</p>
                                    <p>Connect your ASIC to your power supply of choice. It's easy to do this but do
                                        make sure you plug in every connector, you also need to plug your power supply
                                        into your power grid, of course. Don't forget to plug the LAN cable in too.</p>
                                    <p>Choose the Dogecoin mining pool that suits you best</p>
                                    <p>You should have a look at the popular DOGE mining pools and weigh up how these
                                        pay out rewards, what the fees are for mining and also make sure the payment
                                        method suits you. Some of the best pools include Aikapool, BlockMasters and
                                        Multipool. Once you've picked a pool you can go to the mining pool webpage and
                                        create workers, if the pool requires it.</p>

                                    <p>Like other cryptocurrency, you can mine DOGE using a cloud platform, which could
                                        be attractive to you if you don't want to faff with anything technical, prefer
                                        not to make an initial investment or simply don't want to risk the electricity
                                        bills. When you use cloud mining you are basically asking a third party to do
                                        all the work, in exchange for a payment. So, always check the fees involved with
                                        cloud mining and compare it to your mining profits.</p>
                                    <p>You might find some cloud mining vendors offer a couple of months of free mining.
                                        However always make sure you are completely aware of all terms and conditions.

                                    <p>You always need to check your potential earnings before you start to mine, but
                                        you can use our simple calculator. All you need to do is to fill out the power
                                        consumption of your ASIC rig, the rate at which it hashes, electricity prices in
                                        your region - and the fee charged by your mining pool. Tap calculate to see your
                                        results.</p>
                                    <p>Alternatively, to just see the pure sum of money you can make, only complete the
                                        pool fee and the hash rate. Note that, if you choose to use cloud mining, there
                                        will be a fee involved that is a part of your cloud mining contract so you need
                                        to make sure that the income you generate from mining will cover the price you
                                        pay for your cloud mining contract.</p>
                                    <p>Keep in mind that the results below will vary depending on a range of factors
                                        which will change all the time - from block reward, to the value of DOGE and of
                                        course the overall network difficulty. We can show you an estimate for today,

                                    <h3>About Dogecoin</h3>
                                    <p>Billy Markus (from Portland in Oregon) created a coin which he hoped will be fun
                                        and easy to access. Since then, Dogecoin (DOGE) has achieved a big market cap.
                                        Around the same time someone called Jackson Palmer was asked by student on
                                        Twitter to make the idea popular. Jackson used to work for Adobe Systems in
                                        Australia, but as a side project decided to buy the domain dogecoin.com, adding
                                        some basic website elements.</p>
                                    <p>Markus heard about it and the two decided to push Dogecoin, which was derived
                                        from Luckycoin - on its own a version of something called Litecoin. Dogecoin is
                                        based on the Scrypt algorithm and DOGE was released on the 6th of December in
                                        2013, quickly becoming a sensation.</p>
                                    <p>Dogecoin is a fun project - from the whimsical plans behind the coin through to
                                        its mascot, a Shiba Inu. It's no wonder it has become a sensation on the
                                        internet - and it also brings solid opportunities to make profits by mining it.

                                    <p>Jackson Palmer and Billy Marcus worked together to launch Dogecoin, but the
                                        credit for creating DOGE is given to Billy Marcus. Over time the DOGE team is
                                        trying to make Dogecoins even more accessible and even more fun - the idea is to
                                        make it more widespread than Bitcoin.</p>
                                    <p>It is a close community and you can easily get your questions answered by getting
                                        in touch with the DOGE team. Dogecoin's team is also know for raising funds for
                                        good causes, including the Dogecoin Foundation - it's intended to get people to
                                        use Dogecoin for charity causes.</p>

                                    <h3>Technical Details</h3>
                                    <p>Litecoin and Dogecoin uses the same algorithm for hashing - it is called Scrypt,
                                        a result of the SHA-256 hard fork of BTC. Appearances are the Scrypt is in fact
                                        both more efficient and also works more quickly than the BTC hashing algorithm.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>The mining block time for DOGE is just about one minute, while the network
                                        difficulty is much less than it is for Litecoin - which is 2.5 minutes block
                                        time - and of course 10 minutes in the case of Bitcoin.</p>
                                    <p>Interestingly, when you mine DOGE you can do it at the same time as mining
                                        Litecoin. Litecoin is arguably more stable and has a bigger role in the
                                        cryptocurrency market than DOGE, so you hedge your bets, in effect. Mining DOGE
                                        and LTC simultaneously can maximise your mining income.</p>

                                    <h3>Future of Dogecoin</h3>
                                    <p>It is likely that DOGE will incur a hard fork sometime soon. A new project on
                                        Ethereum called Rinkeby will be using DOGE as a test asset - it's cause a lot of
                                        chatter in the cryptocurrency sphere. The expectations is that something called
                                        Dogethereum (DOGX) is going to separate from DOGE's original chain at some
                                        point.</p>
                                    <p>There has never been a hard fork of DOGE, this will be the first one and the plan
                                        is to make an alternative cryptocurrency which will be even faster than DOGE for
                                        processing transactions, while also making use of smart contracts which runs on
                                        Ethereum's blockchain. Users of DOGE and investors in DOGE are rethinking the
                                        value of DOGE as a result.</p>
